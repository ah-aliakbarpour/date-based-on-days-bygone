Determine date based on days bygone.

Enter the number of days since the beginning of Gregorian calendar to get the date of that.

Leap year: In the Gregorian calendar, each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in each year which is an integer multiple of 4, except for years evenly divisible by 100, but not by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.
